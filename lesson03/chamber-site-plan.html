        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>San Juan Capistrano Chamber of Commerce</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Chamber of Commerce for San Juan Capistrano aims to introduce and promote local businesses to the greater population, and to educate business owners through workshops and seminars to help chamber members grow their business.</p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Below are some sample scenarios that this webpage hopes to address.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- What is the schedule for upcoming training and educational events?</li>
            <li>- What sort of support can I receive for hosting events to gain more exposure?</li>
            <li>- What sort of promotions or deals are available to chamber members?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>Earthy colors will be used to reflect the earthy feel of the town's buildings and scenery.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- <span class="color1">#283618</span>: This dark greenish color  will be used for the background of the header, footer, and potentially other sections</li>
            <li>- <span class="color2">#FEFAE0</span>: This light color will be used for text.</li>
            <li>- <span class="color3">#BC6C25</span>: This may be used for highlights and/or h-level text.</li>
            <li>- <span class="color4">#606C38</span> and <span class="color5">#DDA15E</span> may also be used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list is by no means final, but simply some ideas.</p>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Below are two fonts for the site. The first font, Montserrat, will be used as the main font across the site, including in the header and for the larger text. The other font (currently Karla) may or may not be used. (Honestly, I'm on the fence about it, and want to check even more fonts.) This secondary font would be used for smaller text, such as that used below images and/or headlines.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="font1">- Montserrat: This font will be the main font for the site</li>
            <li class="font2">- Karla: This font may be used, or it may be replaced with a different font</li>
        </ul>
