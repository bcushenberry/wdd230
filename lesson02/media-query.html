            <p>The burdens which were laid upon Alma and his
                brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen
                them that they could bear up their burdens with ease,
                and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all
                the will of the Lord</p>

            <p>Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel
                from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that
                he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great
                mercy, over all his works</p>
